          <p style={{ fontFamily: "var(--font-dm-sans), 'DM Sans', sans-serif", fontSize: 16, lineHeight: 1.85, color: TEXT_LIGHT, marginBottom: 24 }}>Federal Heights sits north of Denver near the I-25 and US-36 interchange in Adams County — a practical, working class community where homeowners take their property seriously. The roofing market in Federal Heights sometimes attracts contractors who offer low prices and short warranties, leaving homeowners with work that doesn't hold up. Gates Enterprises operates differently. We bring the same four manufacturer certifications and the same installation standards to every Federal Heights project that we bring to higher end markets across the metro.</p>
          <p style={{ fontFamily: "var(--font-dm-sans), 'DM Sans', sans-serif", fontSize: 16, lineHeight: 1.85, color: TEXT_LIGHT, marginBottom: 24 }}>One of the most common things we see in Federal Heights is homeowners who weren't told about their warranty options when their roof was installed. Manufacturer backed warranties — some covering materials and labor for up to fifty years — are available on certified installations, but only certain contractors are qualified to issue them. As a GAF Master Elite contractor, Gates Enterprises qualifies. We take the time to explain these options so every homeowner can make an informed decision.</p>
          <p style={{ fontFamily: "var(--font-dm-sans), 'DM Sans', sans-serif", fontSize: 16, lineHeight: 1.85, color: TEXT_LIGHT, marginBottom: 40 }}>Federal Heights is positioned to catch hail storms moving through the northern Denver metro. The area near the I-25 corridor sees significant weather activity, and many homes in the community have experienced storm damage that was either not inspected or inspected by contractors without proper credentials. We provide thorough, documented assessments and handle Adams County permit coordination on every project.</p>
