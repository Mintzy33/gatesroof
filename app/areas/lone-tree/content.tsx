            Lone Tree, CO: Douglas County's Hail Corridor

            Lone Tree sits in the heart of Douglas County, one of Colorado's most hail prone areas. The region's proximity to the Palmer Divide creates atmospheric conditions that regularly produce severe thunderstorms with large, damaging hail. Homes with high property values in communities like Heritage Hills, Ridgegate, and Carriage Club are especially important to protect.

          <p style={{ fontFamily: "var(--font-dm-sans), 'DM Sans', sans-serif", fontSize: 16, lineHeight: 1.85, color: TEXT_LIGHT, marginBottom: 28 }}>
            Douglas County consistently ranks among the top counties in Colorado for hail damage insurance claims. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) data confirms that Colorado's Front Range averages more damaging hail events per year than nearly any other region in the country.
