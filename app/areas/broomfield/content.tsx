          <p style={{ fontFamily: "var(--font-dm-sans), 'DM Sans', sans-serif", fontSize: 16, lineHeight: 1.85, color: TEXT_LIGHT, marginBottom: 24 }}>Broomfield holds the unique distinction of being Colorado's only city county — its own independent county with its own permitting jurisdiction. That's a distinction that matters when you're pulling building permits for a roof replacement. Gates Enterprises is familiar with Broomfield County's permitting process and handles the submission, coordination, and inspection scheduling on every project we complete within city limits.</p>
          <p style={{ fontFamily: "var(--font-dm-sans), 'DM Sans', sans-serif", fontSize: 16, lineHeight: 1.85, color: TEXT_LIGHT, marginBottom: 24 }}>Broomfield is home to major technology employers like Oracle and Level 3 Communications, which has driven significant growth in the city's newer subdivisions. These HOA governed communities have specific requirements for roofing materials — approved colors, approved brands, and required documentation for HOA architectural review. Our team manages that process so homeowners in Broomfield's planned communities don't have to navigate it alone.</p>
          <p style={{ fontFamily: "var(--font-dm-sans), 'DM Sans', sans-serif", fontSize: 16, lineHeight: 1.85, color: TEXT_LIGHT, marginBottom: 40 }}>Broomfield also has established older neighborhoods with ranch homes from earlier decades — properties that are reaching the end of their original roofing system's life. These homes tend to be in excellent structural condition, with owners who have maintained them well, but the roof is often the last major system to be updated. We work with these homeowners to select materials that offer the best long term performance value.</p>
