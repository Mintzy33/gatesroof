          <p style={{ fontFamily: "var(--font-dm-sans), 'DM Sans', sans-serif", fontSize: 16, lineHeight: 1.85, color: TEXT_LIGHT, marginBottom: 24 }}>Castle Rock has grown dramatically in recent years. The city now has a diverse mix of very new construction — neighborhoods developed within the last five to ten years — alongside older established communities that have been there for decades. Both face the same Colorado weather realities: Front Range hail storms, high winds, and temperature swings that stress roofing systems year round. The iconic rhyolite rock landscape surrounding the city makes it one of the most visually striking places in Douglas County, and the homes here deserve roofing that matches the character of the community.</p>
          <p style={{ fontFamily: "var(--font-dm-sans), 'DM Sans', sans-serif", fontSize: 16, lineHeight: 1.85, color: TEXT_LIGHT, marginBottom: 24 }}>One of the most common complaints we hear from Castle Rock homeowners is that contractors from Denver or the northern suburbs simply won't come this far south. Some say they'll come and then cancel, or charge extra for the distance. Gates Enterprises has served Castle Rock consistently for years. We build it into our schedule, our pricing is transparent, and there are no travel surcharges hidden in your estimate.</p>
          <p style={{ fontFamily: "var(--font-dm-sans), 'DM Sans', sans-serif", fontSize: 16, lineHeight: 1.85, color: TEXT_LIGHT, marginBottom: 40 }}>Castle Rock's location along the I-25 corridor means it catches hail storms moving both north and south along the Front Range. We've documented damage from multiple significant hail events in Castle Rock neighborhoods in recent years, and our insurance restoration team handles the documentation and carrier coordination process for homeowners navigating those claims.</p>
