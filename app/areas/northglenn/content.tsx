          <p style={{ fontFamily: "var(--font-dm-sans), 'DM Sans', sans-serif", fontSize: 16, lineHeight: 1.85, color: TEXT_LIGHT, marginBottom: 24 }}>Northglenn was developed as a planned suburb in the 1960s, and it retains a strong residential character today. The city's housing stock is among the most consistent in Adams County — block after block of well built ranch homes from that era, many still occupied by long term residents or second generation families. These homes are durable and well maintained in most cases, but their roofing systems are aging. A roof installed in the 1990s or even the early 2000s is reaching the end of its designed lifespan, and Gates Enterprises is seeing a steady stream of Northglenn homeowners who are dealing with that reality.</p>
          <p style={{ fontFamily: "var(--font-dm-sans), 'DM Sans', sans-serif", fontSize: 16, lineHeight: 1.85, color: TEXT_LIGHT, marginBottom: 24 }}>Northglenn's position in the north Denver metro means it catches hail storms that track in from the north — events that sometimes affect Northglenn neighborhoods before they hit communities further south. This northern exposure creates a pattern of storm damage that compounds over time on roofs that are already aging, accelerating deterioration that might otherwise take another decade to become critical.</p>
          <p style={{ fontFamily: "var(--font-dm-sans), 'DM Sans', sans-serif", fontSize: 16, lineHeight: 1.85, color: TEXT_LIGHT, marginBottom: 40 }}>Northglenn's community is family oriented and value conscious. We approach every project here with the kind of honesty and transparency that works in a tight knit neighborhood — because referrals matter, and we earn them by doing exactly what we said we would, on time and on budget.</p>
