          <p style={{ fontFamily: "var(--font-dm-sans), 'DM Sans', sans-serif", fontSize: 16, lineHeight: 1.85, color: TEXT_LIGHT, marginBottom: 24 }}>Littleton is one of those communities where word of mouth matters most. Established neighborhoods with long term residents mean that doing excellent work leads directly to referrals — and doing poor work gets talked about just as quickly. Gates Enterprises has built a strong presence in Littleton because our customers in Ken Caryl, the South Platte Valley area, and neighborhoods near Historic Downtown Littleton recommend us to their neighbors without hesitation.</p>
          <p style={{ fontFamily: "var(--font-dm-sans), 'DM Sans', sans-serif", fontSize: 16, lineHeight: 1.85, color: TEXT_LIGHT, marginBottom: 24 }}>Littleton spans Douglas County and Arapahoe County, which means two separate permitting jurisdictions depending on your location. Our team knows which permits to pull for your specific address and handles that coordination without delay. The 1970s through 1990s housing stock in many Littleton neighborhoods means roof systems are reaching end of life — and the combination of age and storm exposure from Colorado's active hail seasons creates real urgency for homeowners who haven't had a professional inspection recently.</p>
          <p style={{ fontFamily: "var(--font-dm-sans), 'DM Sans', sans-serif", fontSize: 16, lineHeight: 1.85, color: TEXT_LIGHT, marginBottom: 40 }}>Historic Downtown Littleton also presents unique situations where historic character and modern performance need to be balanced. We work carefully in these contexts to recommend materials and approaches that meet both practical performance standards and the aesthetic sensibility of the neighborhood.</p>
