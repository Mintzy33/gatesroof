          <p style={{ fontFamily: "var(--font-dm-sans), 'DM Sans', sans-serif", fontSize: 16, lineHeight: 1.85, color: TEXT_LIGHT, marginBottom: 24 }}>Commerce City is a working community with a mix of industrial areas and established residential neighborhoods where families have lived for generations. Homeowners here tend to be practical and value driven — they want the work done correctly, they want transparent pricing, and they don't want to be pressured into buying more than what their home actually needs. That's exactly the approach Gates Enterprises brings to every inspection we do in Commerce City.</p>
          <p style={{ fontFamily: "var(--font-dm-sans), 'DM Sans', sans-serif", fontSize: 16, lineHeight: 1.85, color: TEXT_LIGHT, marginBottom: 24 }}>Commerce City's eastern position near the plains makes it particularly vulnerable to hail storms that build up over flat terrain before reaching the Denver metro. Storms coming in from the northeast can be especially intense by the time they reach Commerce City, and the residential neighborhoods near the Colorado Rapids stadium area have experienced significant hail events in recent years. After a major storm, we respond quickly to get inspections completed and insurance restoration documentation started before the claims backlog builds up.</p>
          <p style={{ fontFamily: "var(--font-dm-sans), 'DM Sans', sans-serif", fontSize: 16, lineHeight: 1.85, color: TEXT_LIGHT, marginBottom: 40 }}>We work with Adams County permitting on all Commerce City roof replacements and coordinate the inspection process from start to finish. Our goal is to make the process as simple as possible for homeowners who are busy and don't have time to chase contractors or manage paperwork.</p>
