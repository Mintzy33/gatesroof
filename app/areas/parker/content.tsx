          <p style={{ fontFamily: "var(--font-dm-sans), 'DM Sans', sans-serif", fontSize: 16, lineHeight: 1.85, color: TEXT_LIGHT, marginBottom: 24 }}>Parker's rapid growth over the past two decades has produced thousands of homes with roofs installed in the 2000s and 2010s. Many Parker homeowners assume that because their home is relatively new, the roof is fine. Colorado's hail corridor doesn't care how old your roof is — we've documented significant hail damage on roofs that were installed as recently as five years ago. A professional inspection is the only way to know for certain what condition your roof is actually in.</p>
          <p style={{ fontFamily: "var(--font-dm-sans), 'DM Sans', sans-serif", fontSize: 16, lineHeight: 1.85, color: TEXT_LIGHT, marginBottom: 24 }}>Parker's equestrian and outdoor community lifestyle reflects a higher income area with homeowners who invest in their properties. That means choosing quality materials that will last, hold their warranty, and maintain curb appeal over the long term. As a GAF Master Elite contractor, Gates Enterprises offers the full range of premium GAF product lines and manufacturer backed warranties up to fifty years — including fully transferable warranties that add value at resale.</p>
          <p style={{ fontFamily: "var(--font-dm-sans), 'DM Sans', sans-serif", fontSize: 16, lineHeight: 1.85, color: TEXT_LIGHT, marginBottom: 40 }}>Parker's position in the far southeast of the Denver metro means some contractors simply won't make the drive. Gates Enterprises regularly serves Parker and the surrounding Douglas County area — the distance is not a factor for us, and Parker homeowners get the same crew quality and project standards as any other market we serve.</p>
