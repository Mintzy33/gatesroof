          <p style={{ fontFamily: "var(--font-dm-sans), 'DM Sans', sans-serif", fontSize: 16, lineHeight: 1.85, color: TEXT_LIGHT, marginBottom: 24 }}>Aurora has earned a reputation as one of the most hail active cities in Colorado, and that's not an exaggeration. Storms rolling off the plains regularly produce large hail that hammers neighborhoods from Saddle Rock in the south all the way up through the Stapleton adjacent areas near the Denver border. For homeowners in these neighborhoods, roof damage isn't a question of if — it's a question of when and how severe.</p>
          <p style={{ fontFamily: "var(--font-dm-sans), 'DM Sans', sans-serif", fontSize: 16, lineHeight: 1.85, color: TEXT_LIGHT, marginBottom: 24 }}>Aurora's large HOA communities in areas like Tallyn's Reach and Southlands add a layer of complexity that not every contractor is prepared for. HOAs control approved material lists, color palettes, and installation standards. Gates Enterprises has built working relationships with multiple Aurora HOA boards and knows which manufacturers and product lines are pre-approved in the most common communities. We handle the HOA submission process alongside the Arapahoe County permit process.</p>
          <p style={{ fontFamily: "var(--font-dm-sans), 'DM Sans', sans-serif", fontSize: 16, lineHeight: 1.85, color: TEXT_LIGHT, marginBottom: 40 }}>Much of Aurora's housing stock dates from the 2000s through 2010s — relatively newer construction, but not immune to hail damage. Many homeowners assume a newer roof is fine. Hail doesn't discriminate by age, and we've documented significant damage on roofs that were less than ten years old. Our free inspection gives you a factual, photo documented assessment rather than guesswork.</p>
