          <p style={{ fontFamily: "var(--font-dm-sans), 'DM Sans', sans-serif", fontSize: 16, lineHeight: 1.85, color: TEXT_LIGHT, marginBottom: 24 }}>Thornton is one of Colorado's fastest growing cities, and its roofing market reflects that dynamic. The city has established neighborhoods from the 1980s and 1990s where homes are approaching or have exceeded the lifespan of their original roofing systems, sitting alongside newer subdivisions built in the 2000s and 2010s. Gates Enterprises serves homeowners across all of these neighborhoods — from families looking to replace an aging system before it fails to those dealing with fresh storm damage.</p>
          <p style={{ fontFamily: "var(--font-dm-sans), 'DM Sans', sans-serif", fontSize: 16, lineHeight: 1.85, color: TEXT_LIGHT, marginBottom: 24 }}>The I-25 corridor through Thornton and Adams County sees frequent hail events, particularly during late spring and summer storm seasons. Storms tracking north along the Front Range regularly produce damaging hail in Thornton, and the city's density means thousands of homes can be affected by a single event. After a major storm, we prioritize rapid response — getting our inspectors out quickly so homeowners can start the insurance restoration process without delay.</p>
          <p style={{ fontFamily: "var(--font-dm-sans), 'DM Sans', sans-serif", fontSize: 16, lineHeight: 1.85, color: TEXT_LIGHT, marginBottom: 40 }}>Thornton homeowners tend to be practical and family focused. We respect that by being straightforward about what your roof actually needs — not overselling, not pressuring, and not recommending work that isn't necessary. If a repair will do the job, we'll tell you that. If a full replacement is the right call, we'll explain exactly why and back it up with evidence.</p>
