          <p style={{ fontFamily: "var(--font-dm-sans), 'DM Sans', sans-serif", fontSize: 16, lineHeight: 1.85, color: TEXT_LIGHT, marginBottom: 24 }}>Lakewood is home base for Gates Enterprises, and we take that seriously. Our crews drive these streets every single day. We know which neighborhoods have the 1960s through 1980s ranch homes that are long overdue for a full replacement, and we know the wind patterns that come barreling down from the foothills through the Applewood area and over Green Mountain. That local knowledge means we assess your roof the right way — not the generic way.</p>
          <p style={{ fontFamily: "var(--font-dm-sans), 'DM Sans', sans-serif", fontSize: 16, lineHeight: 1.85, color: TEXT_LIGHT, marginBottom: 24 }}>Lakewood's position as the gateway to the mountains creates roof stress that's different from the rest of the metro. Wind speeds regularly exceed what asphalt shingles can handle without proper installation — which is why proper nailing patterns, starter strips, and ridge cap installation are non-negotiable on every project we complete here. We've seen wind damage rip improperly installed shingles off roofs that were only a few years old.</p>
          <p style={{ fontFamily: "var(--font-dm-sans), 'DM Sans', sans-serif", fontSize: 16, lineHeight: 1.85, color: TEXT_LIGHT, marginBottom: 40 }}>We work closely with the Jefferson County permit office for all Lakewood projects. Permits are pulled before work begins, and every job is closed with a passed inspection. We've built a strong working relationship with the county over thousands of completed projects — which means no delays and no surprises for Lakewood homeowners.</p>
