          <p style={{ fontFamily: "var(--font-dm-sans), 'DM Sans', sans-serif", fontSize: 16, lineHeight: 1.85, color: TEXT_LIGHT, marginBottom: 24 }}>Englewood is a compact, dense city directly south of Denver, and its housing stock reflects that urban character. The area is home to a significant number of flat and low slope roofing systems — commercial style TPO and modified bitumen membranes on residential properties — alongside more traditional pitched asphalt shingle roofs. Many contractors specialize in one or the other. Gates Enterprises is qualified to handle both, which matters when your Englewood property has a combination roof system.</p>
          <p style={{ fontFamily: "var(--font-dm-sans), 'DM Sans', sans-serif", fontSize: 16, lineHeight: 1.85, color: TEXT_LIGHT, marginBottom: 24 }}>Englewood's homeowners tend to be quality driven but price conscious — they want the work done right without being oversold. We respect that approach completely. Our inspections are honest assessments of what's actually needed. If a targeted repair is the appropriate solution, we'll recommend that over a full replacement. If a full replacement is necessary, we'll explain the specific reasons and document everything with photos.</p>
          <p style={{ fontFamily: "var(--font-dm-sans), 'DM Sans', sans-serif", fontSize: 16, lineHeight: 1.85, color: TEXT_LIGHT, marginBottom: 40 }}>Proximity to Denver also means that Englewood properties face the same hail corridor risk as the larger city. Several notable hail events have caused damage throughout Englewood neighborhoods in recent years. Our Xactimate certified team works directly with insurance carriers on restoration claims, helping Englewood homeowners navigate the documentation process efficiently.</p>
